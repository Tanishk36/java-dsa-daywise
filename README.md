## 📂 Problems Implemented

| Problem | Platform | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Two Sum | LeetCode | HashMap |
| Subsets | LeetCode 78 | Recursion (Include / Exclude) |

---

## 🧠 Example: Subsets (LeetCode 78)

**Approach:**  
At every index, we choose:
- Include the element
- Exclude the element  
This generates all possible subsets.

**Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
